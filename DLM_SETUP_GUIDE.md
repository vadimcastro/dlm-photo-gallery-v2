# ðŸ“¸ DLM Photo Gallery Setup Guide

## Project Overview

**DLM Photo Gallery v2** is Dan's enhanced photo gallery application built with the vadim-project-template infrastructure. It provides a professional, production-ready photo management system with real-time monitoring and mobile-responsive design.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Production monitoring
- **Deployment**: Automated with comprehensive Makefile

## Quick Start (10 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Terminal access
- Basic familiarity with command line

### 1. Navigate to Project
```bash
# Using shell navigation
cd ~/Desktop/PROJECTS/dlm-photo-gallery-v2

# Or create an alias for quick access
echo 'dlmv2() { cd ~/Desktop/PROJECTS/dlm-photo-gallery-v2; }' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
dlmv2                     # Now you can use this shortcut
```

### 2. Start Development Environment
```bash
# Start all services (database, API, frontend, monitoring)
make dev

# Wait for services to initialize (30-60 seconds)
# Look for: "âœ… All services started successfully"
```

### 3. Setup Authentication
```bash
# In a new terminal window/tab (keep make dev running)
cd ~/Desktop/PROJECTS/dlm-photo-gallery-v2

# Configure authentication for Dan
make setup-local-auth

# Should see: âœ… Local authentication working!
```

### 4. Access the Photo Gallery

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start development
dlmv2                     # Navigate to project
make dev                  # Start all services

# View logs while developing
make logs                 # See all service logs

# Stop when done
make down                 # Stop all services
```

### Adding Photo Features

**1. Database Models:**
```bash
# Create photo-related migrations
make migrate-create name=create_photos_table
make migrate-create name=create_albums_table

# Run migrations
make migrate
```

**2. Frontend Development:**
- Edit files in `frontend/src/`
- Hot reload enabled (changes appear instantly)
- Add photo components in `frontend/src/components/`

**3. Backend API:**
- Add photo endpoints in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
- Create photo models in `backend/app/models/`
- Implement photo CRUD in `backend/app/crud/`

### File Upload Implementation
```bash
# Example photo upload endpoint structure:
# POST /api/v1/photos/upload
# GET /api/v1/photos/
# GET /api/v1/photos/{id}
# DELETE /api/v1/photos/{id}
# POST /api/v1/albums/
# GET /api/v1/albums/{id}/photos
```

## Production Deployment

### Server Requirements
- Ubuntu server (DigitalOcean recommended)
- 2GB+ RAM (for photo processing)
- SSH access configured
- Docker installed

### Deploy to Production
```bash
# Setup production environment
make setup-prod-env

# Configure production server in Makefile
# Edit: PRODUCTION_IP=206.81.2.168 (your server IP)

# Deploy to production
make droplet-deploy

# Quick deploy for updates
make droplet-quick-deploy
```

### Production Management
```bash
# Check photo gallery status
make droplet-status

# View application logs
make droplet-logs

# Monitor system performance
# Visit: http://your-server-ip:3000/dashboard

# Server maintenance
make droplet-deep-clean   # Cleanup disk space
make droplet-disk-usage   # Check storage usage
```

## Photo Storage Strategy

### Local Development
- Store photos in `frontend/public/uploads/`
- Use relative paths in database
- Automatic thumbnail generation

### Production Options
1. **Server Storage**: Direct file storage on droplet
2. **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2
3. **CDN Integration**: For faster image delivery

### Recommended Storage Structure
```
uploads/
â”œâ”€â”€ photos/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ originals/     # Full-resolution photos
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ thumbnails/    # Small previews
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ medium/        # Medium-sized versions
â”œâ”€â”€ albums/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ covers/        # Album cover images
â””â”€â”€ temp/              # Temporary upload processing
```

## Development Tips

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Add photo-specific components
mkdir frontend/src/components/photos
mkdir frontend/src/components/albums

# Suggested components:
# - PhotoUploader.tsx
# - PhotoGrid.tsx
# - PhotoModal.tsx
# - AlbumView.tsx
# - PhotoMetadata.tsx
```

### Backend Development
```bash
# Photo-related backend structure
mkdir backend/app/models/photo
mkdir backend/app/schemas/photo
mkdir backend/app/crud/photo

# Add to requirements-minimal.txt:
# Pillow==10.0.1  # Image processing
# python-multipart==0.0.6  # File uploads (already included)
```

### Database Design
```sql
-- Photos table
CREATE TABLE photos (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    original_name VARCHAR(255),
    file_size INTEGER,
    mime_type VARCHAR(100),
    width INTEGER,
    height INTEGER,
    taken_at TIMESTAMP,
    upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    album_id INTEGER REFERENCES albums(id)
);

-- Albums table
CREATE TABLE albums (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    cover_photo_id INTEGER REFERENCES photos(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Monitoring & Performance

### Photo Gallery Metrics
The dashboard includes monitoring for:
- **Storage Usage**: Track photo storage consumption
- **Upload Performance**: Monitor upload speeds and failures
- **Gallery Views**: Track photo access patterns
- **System Load**: Ensure server handles photo processing

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Image processing can be CPU intensive
# Monitor with: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# Optimize for production:
# 1. Use WebP format for web delivery
# 2. Generate multiple sizes (thumbnail, medium, full)
# 3. Implement lazy loading
# 4. Use CDN for static assets
```

## Security Considerations

### Photo Access Control
- Authentication required for upload
- Photo access controls (public/private)
- Secure file upload validation
- EXIF data sanitization

### File Upload Security
```python
# Backend validation example:
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.webp'}
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Photo Gallery Issues

**Upload Failures:**
```bash
# Check API logs
docker compose logs api

# Verify file permissions
docker compose exec api ls -la /app/uploads

# Check disk space
make droplet-disk-usage
```

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Monitor system resources
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# Check database performance
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d dlm-photo-gallery-v2
\l  # List databases
```

**Image Processing Problems:**
```bash
# Install image processing dependencies
docker compose exec api pip install Pillow

# Test image operations
docker compose exec api python -c "from PIL import Image; print('Image processing OK')"
```
